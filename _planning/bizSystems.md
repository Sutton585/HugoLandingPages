# Page Build Plan
## Objective
This plan outlines the conversion of the current Notion page content into a final, high-performance landing page. The primary goal is a rapid deployment using pre-built Hugoplate components, adapting the existing copy to fit the new, strategic layout.

## Process
1. Review Source Content: Analyze the current version of the page as it exisits in our current Notion version of the landing page. (`## Current Notion Version`)
2. Incorporate Feedback: Integrate the strategic improvements and suggestions for the newer version. (`## Proposed improved version to consider`)
3. Develop a Rapid Draft: Adapt the existing copy for a quick launch, focusing on the most critical messaging for our goal and intended personas (leverage-first, use 80/20 rule). 
4. Map Page Structure: Outline the page by sequencing the required Hugoplate design components. (`## Outline with Prebuilt Design Components`)
5. Build and Deploy: Assemble the final page ready for Hugo publishing.(`## Full Version`)

    Page: Less technical owner-operator persona Landing Page (Targetting smaller home services local SMBs that are drowning in ops, and underdigitized. I want to help them free themselves from the choas, impress them, then if they're looking for a retirement path, pitch seller-financed buyout. By that time, I'm hoping to have systems in place to make it more hands-off and a more passive income stream.)

    ### *Your grit keeps your business running.
    
    What happens when you aren’t there?**
    
    When everything goes through you, your hours are the bottle-neck for business growth, and time off is impossible.
    
    I create low-maintenance systems to enable business growth and ease the pressure on you.

    # Why you’re here
    
    - You built something that *works well* because you work *hard*.
    - You lead from the front; everything is slower when you aren’t hands-on.
    - If someone suggests shiny new tech and buzzwords, you're tuning them out.
    - You want time for yourself and a business that runs smooth without you having to play babysitter.

    seperated into three main parts of the process. I interview and observe their operations to find pain points an inefficiencies, make my observations about bottle necks and weak links, then develop systems and tools to re-enforce their processes. Automation, ai, tech, whitelabel solutions, hardware solutions, etc. The idea is that this persona type is underdigitized and not technical, maybe even skeptical of tech being introduced. We want to make sure they see that we aren't mindlessly throwing confusing tech at them that will require lots of onboarding time and adjustments to their system. They see it as "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", but they don't see that it IS broke, they're drowning. if i pitch tech, they tune out. i need them to know it's only enough tech to support what they're already doing, not tech to overhaul everything they know and trust.

    # How It Works
    
    We start with a free audit to find what's slowing you down. Then I work in the background clearing the way so you can stay focused on what you do best.
    
    ### 1. Hunt down the trouble-makers
    
    Mapping out the approvals, processes, and tasks that can pile up and create blocks.
    
    ### 2. What breaks first?
    
    Finding weak-links where missing people, messy tools, or unclear steps can create problems.
    
    ### 3. Re-enforcement
    
    Keep everything going while I clear the path; quiet adjustments so you can move faster, hit harder and build momentum.
    
    > start the next section: CTA for the to contact me and set up a call or something. I might need to develop better lead magnet ideas for this persona type. Maybe an intake form that surfaces some low hanging fruit problems they're having that I know I can easily address with simple automations and whitelabel solutions.
    > 
    
    # Fix what's breaking. Protect what's working.
    
    No buzzwords. No big overhaul. Just smart fixes to free you up.
    
    *Request a free initial audit; my work won't interrupt yours.*

    > start of next section: CTA for when a different target persona type has been routed to this page instead of their dedicated landing page. Whether it's the more technically-aware founder/leader or the UX-focused persona, I put this CTA here so they will see that I can hepl them too, not just the persona this landing page is meant for, it routes them to my UX landing page and portfolio since that has clear work samples and such.

    > start of new section: brief "work history" section called "recent wins" that is almost like the job history section of a resume for context and authority. might be worth deleting this section, it might be redundant. might be worth using "blog posts" here for similar effect. unsure. I have a slightly different version of this section on each landing page, but it seems messy to maintain.
    Current idea: take this part of each landing page, combine into one master version, include on UX page as smaller "case studies".

    # Featured Work
    
    Examples of real impact: Smooth business processes, intuitive products and measurable results.
    
    ### Monroe Community College - Healthcare Admin Overhaul
    
    (Pro Bono Consult)
    
    **Challenges:**
    
    A tangled mess of conflicting spreadsheets was draining time and slowing down a nursing certification program at Monroe Community College. So much of their program depended on these files, but there were different versions for different instructors and it wasn’t always clear when they were out-of-date.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Audited, rebuilt and automated the tedious workflows that were the real trouble-makers.
    - Centralized the documentation and input for all grading, class scheduling, staff communications, enrollment updates and more.
    
    **Results:**
    
    Saved hours of admin time, reduced errors, and left them with a scalable system that lives on today.
    
    ### WAE – Product Design & Ops for Rapid Growth
    
    **Challenges:**
    
    A fast-growing startup faced UX debt, misaligned teams, and chaotic scheduling workflows.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Rolled out a dual-track DesignOps system.
    - Rebuilt scheduling flows using embedded user testing.
    - Created reusable, modular UX documentation for scale.
    
    **Results:**
    
    - 2× faster job scheduling.
    - +44% user satisfaction.
    - Scalable systems now in place across teams.
    
    ### PepsiCo + MSM – Gamification Systems for Live Engagement
    
    **Challenges:**
    
    Clients needed interactive tools for marketing and onboarding in high-stakes environments.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Developed real-time interactive tools for brand activations.
    - Designed gamified onboarding flows using rapid design sprints.
    
    **Results:**
    
    - Boosted event engagement and user retention.
    - Seamless onboarding across multiple platforms.
    
    ### Xerox – Enterprise UX/Product Dev Modernization
    
    **Challenges:**
    
    Slow, siloed feedback cycles and a lack of scalable design/dev alignment.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Rolled out modular prototyping and handoff systems.
    - Integrated design ops across teams to streamline feedback loops.
    
    **Results:**
    
    - Cut design-to-dev lag by 80% with rapid prototype-driven user-testing cycles.
    - Unified product pipelines.
    - Reduced wasted effort across teams.
    
    ### RIT – Founder & Community Builder Addressing Resource Gaps
    
    **Challenges:**
    
    No infrastructure for design testing or critique in the curriculum.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Created "Crashtest," a scalable UX testing group embedded into academic programs.
    - Built templates and onboarding flows for repeatable student involvement.
    
    **Results:**
    
    - Supported hundreds of students across disciplines.
    - Adopted into RIT’s formal curriculum.
    - Still running independently under faculty leadership.

## Proposed improved version to consider

    - less-techy SMB owner operator v2
    
    # Business Systems Page: Strategic Layout & Analysis
    
    ## Page: /business-systems (The Acquisition Funnel)
    
    ### **Strategic Function**
    
    This page's sole purpose is to attract and convert overwhelmed, non-technical SMB owner-operators. It is an **acquisition funnel**. The strategy is to build trust by demonstrating a deep understanding of their specific operational pain—being the bottleneck. The messaging is entirely non-technical and empathetic. The goal is to get them to agree to a low-friction "Quiet Audit," which serves as your entry point for observing their operations, delivering a quick win, and identifying a potential path to a seller-financed buyout.
    
    ---
    
    ## Revised Page Structure & Content
    
    ### **Section 1: Hero**
    
    - **Component Type:** Hero Section
    - **Intention:** To immediately and empathetically state the core problem. The copy correctly identifies the owner's "grit" as both their greatest asset and their biggest liability. It hooks them by acknowledging their hard work while simultaneously highlighting the trap it has created.
    
    ---
    
    # Your business runs on your grit. What happens when you step away?
    
    When everything goes through you, your hours are the bottleneck for business growth, and time off is impossible. I create quiet, low-maintenance systems that free you up.
    
    **[Button: Start Your Free "Quiet Audit" →]**
    
    > NOTE: The copy is perfect—empathetic and direct. I've replaced the generic email/linkedin links with a single, clear button CTA that drives the visitor to the page's primary offer. This is the first and most important action they can take.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 2: The Problem**
    
    - **Component Type:** Empathy / Qualification Section
    - **Intention:** To make the visitor feel seen and understood. This section confirms they are in the right place by describing their exact situation in their own terms. It builds trust by showing you "get it" before you even propose a solution.
    
    ---
    
    ## Does This Sound Familiar?
    
    - [x]  You built something that works *well* because you work *hard*.
    - [x]  You lead from the front, so everything slows when you aren’t hands-on.
    - [x]  You immediately tune out anyone suggesting tech buzzwords or overhauls.
    - [x]  You want a business that runs smoothly without you playing babysitter.
    
    > NOTE: This is an excellent use of a "checklist" component. Renaming it "Does This Sound Familiar?" is more direct and engaging than "Why you're here." This content perfectly qualifies your target persona. No changes to the copy are needed.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 3: The Solution**
    
    - **Component Type:** Process Section
    - **Intention:** To explain your process in the simplest, most non-threatening terms possible. This section demystifies what you do and emphasizes that the process is low-impact on their day-to-day work.
    
    ---
    
    # How It Works
    
    We start with a free audit to find what's slowing you down. Then, I work quietly in the background to clear the path, so you can stay focused on what you do best.
    
    ### **1. Find the Bottlenecks**
    
    First, I map out the approvals, processes, and daily tasks that pile up and get stuck waiting for you.
    
    ### **2. Identify the Weak Links**
    
    Next, we find the exact points where a missing person, messy tool, or unclear step could cause a problem.
    
    ### **3. Quietly Reinforce**
    
    Finally, I implement simple, durable fixes. No big overhauls, just smart adjustments so you can move faster and build momentum without disruption.
    
    > NOTE: This 3-step process is clear and effective. The language ("Hunt down trouble-makers," "What breaks first?") is strong and non-corporate. It perfectly communicates your value without using a single word of tech jargon.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 4: The Proof (replace with Jer’s Testimonial)**
    
    - **Component Type:** Case Study
    - **Intention:** To provide a relatable example of your work. The key is that the proof must resonate with the target persona. A story about escaping spreadsheet chaos is far more powerful here than a story about enterprise software development.
    
    ---
    
    ## Case Study: Escaping Spreadsheet Chaos
    
    **The Problem:** A vital healthcare certification program was managed through a patchwork of conflicting Google Sheets, causing frequent errors, wasted time, and staff burnout.
    
    **The Fix:** I audited and rebuilt their internal operations with scalable logic. I automated retest scheduling, grading, and tracking using simple, centralized tools they already had.
    
    **The Result:** Slashed instructor admin time, eliminated costly errors, and delivered a reusable, scalable system for future cohorts without a complicated tech overhaul.
    
    > NOTE: I have ruthlessly cut the other case studies. For this persona, examples from Xerox, PepsiCo, and even WAE are irrelevant and potentially intimidating. They create a disconnect. The MCC story is perfect because it's about fixing a real-world administrative mess—a problem this persona understands intimately. You must get more testimonials and case studies from this type of client.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 5: The Offer**
    
    - **Component Type:** Lead Magnet / Final CTA
    - **Intention:** This is the page's climax. It clearly restates the value proposition and directs the user to a single, compelling action: requesting the free audit.
    
    ---
    
    # Fix what's breaking. Protect what's working.
    
    No buzzwords. No big overhaul. Just smart, quiet fixes to free you from the daily grind. My work won't interrupt yours.
    
    **[Button: Request Your Free Initial Audit →]**
    
    > NOTE: This is the final call to action. It should lead to a simple intake form or quiz (as you mentioned) that asks a few targeted questions about their business operations. This "productizes" your audit, makes it feel official, and gives you valuable intel before your first conversation. The weak email/linkedin CTA has been replaced with a strong, offer-driven button.
    > 
    
    ### **Removed Sections & Rationale**
    
    - **Cross-Sell CTA ("Got a product idea...?"):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** This is a critical funnel leak. The home page already triaged the visitor here for a specific reason. Offering them an exit to another page shows a lack of confidence and confuses the user journey. This page must have a single focus: converting the SMB owner.
    - **Testimonials (from UX/Academic World):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** These testimonials are completely misaligned with the target persona. A skeptical SMB owner will not be persuaded by praise from a UX designer or a university lecturer. In fact, it may actively harm your credibility by positioning you as part of the "tech world" they distrust. You **must** get testimonials from other business owners, even if they are small pro-bono projects. Until then, it is better to have no testimonials on this page than the wrong ones.
