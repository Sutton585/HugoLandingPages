# Page Build Plan
## Objective
This plan outlines the conversion of the current Notion page content into a final, high-performance landing page. The primary goal is a rapid deployment using pre-built Hugoplate components, adapting the existing copy to fit the new, strategic layout.

## Process
1. Review Source Content: Analyze the current version of the page as it exisits in our current Notion version of the landing page. (`## Current Notion Version`)
2. Incorporate Feedback: Integrate the strategic improvements and suggestions for the newer version. (`## Proposed improved version to consider`)
3. Develop a Rapid Draft: Adapt the existing copy for a quick launch, focusing on the most critical messaging for our goal and intended personas (leverage-first, use 80/20 rule). 
4. Map Page Structure: Outline the page by sequencing the required Hugoplate design components. (`## Outline with Prebuilt Design Components`)
5. Build and Deploy: Assemble the final page ready for Hugo publishing.(`## Full Version`)

    ## Staffing UX & Product Teams?
    
    I de-risk UX hiring, ops and delivery by building flexible systems for scale.
    
    *Want to see how it could work for your team?* ("learn more" button)
    
    ## Business stalls without you?
    
    If business slows without you, that’s a bottleneck I can help fix.
    
    *Are you a business owner or a business babysitter?* ("learn more" button)
    
    ## Scaling in controlled chaos?
    
    Duct-tape scaling isn’t a phase, it’s a red flag. I quietly get your team out of the weeds fast.

    > start of new section: brief "work history" section called "recent wins" that is almost like the job history section of a resume for context and authority. might be worth deleting this section, it might be redundant. might be worth using "blog posts" here for similar effect. unsure. I have a slightly different version of this section on each landing page, but it seems messy to maintain.

## Proposed improved version to consider

    
    ## Page: /index (The Triage Hub)
    
    ### **Strategic Function**
    
    This page has one job: **triage**. It must instantly categorize a visitor and direct them to the appropriate funnel with zero friction. It establishes your core value proposition as a builder of systems that create leverage, validates your credibility through social proof, and then forces a clear choice. Anything that does not serve this primary function has been removed to maximize conversion into the funnels.
    
    ## Revised Page Structure & Content
    
    ### **Section 1: Hero**
    
    - **Component Type:** Hero Section
    - **Intention:** To immediately resonate with a visitor's primary pain point and establish broad authority. The headline poses questions that pre-qualify the visitor, and the sub-headline offers proof (Apple, Verizon, Xerox) that you solve these problems at the highest level.

    Staffing UX? Drowning in operations? Scaling but seeing delays?
    
    From startups to Fortune 500 enterprise teams at Apple, Verizon, and Xerox, I've spent over a decade helping teams get unstuck and streamlined.
    
    *Tired of putting out fires? Let’s write your next chapter together.*
    
    > NOTE: Your copy is strong and hits the key pain points. The original CTA (email/linkedin) is too weak for a hero and distracts from the main goal. It asks for a commitment before the user even knows what you offer. We've removed it. The implicit CTA of a hero section is to keep reading. The goal is to get them to scroll down to the Triage Panels, which is now the next logical step.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 2: Social Proof**
    
    - **Component Type:** Testimonials Section
    - **Intention:** To build trust and establish credibility *before* asking the user to make a choice. By placing this high on the page, you validate yourself as a respected professional, which de-risks the decision they are about to make in the Triage section.

    > [GEM COACH NOTE]: These testimonials are excellent for establishing community leadership and credibility. Placing them here builds trust, making the user more confident when they choose one of the funnels below. This is a standard and effective use of a testimonial block.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 3: The Triage**
    
    - **Component Type:** Feature List / Service Selector
    - **Intention:** This is the functional core of the page. It forces the visitor to self-identify and choose their own adventure. Each card speaks directly to the pain of a specific persona and funnels them to a landing page tailored exclusively for them.
    
    ## Staffing UX & Product Teams?
    
    I de-risk UX hiring, ops and delivery by building flexible systems for scale.
    
    *Want to see how it could work for your team?***[Button: Fix Your Design Operations →]**
    
    ## Business stalls without you?
    
    If business slows without you, that’s a bottleneck I can help fix.
    
    *Are you a business owner or a business babysitter?***[Button: Reclaim Your Time →]**
    
    ## Scaling in controlled chaos?
    
    Duct-tape scaling isn’t a phase, it’s a red flag. I quietly get your team out of the weeds fast.
    
    *Want to see life **after** survival-mode?***[Button: Audit Your Technical Ops →]**
    
    > NOTE: I've converted the final line of each card into a clear, action-oriented button CTA that matches our strategic framework. This is the most important interactive element on the page. The user's entire journey starts here. Using buttons instead of simple "learn more" text increases click-through rates.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 4: Footer / Final Contact**
    
    - **Component Type:** Footer
    - **Intention:** To provide a simple, final point of contact for users who don't fit the main funnels or prefer direct outreach, and to house standard footer information.
    
    ## Not sure where to start?
    
    Whether you need help untangling your operations or building something new, I'll meet you where you are. Let’s talk!

    > NOTE: This final, low-priority CTA is now part of the footer. It serves as a passive catch-all without competing with the main Triage section.
    > 
    
    ### **Removed Sections & Rationale**
    
    - **Featured Work (Portfolio Gallery):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** This section is a major distraction from the page's primary goal of **triage**. Showing a generic portfolio here undermines the strategy of sending specific personas to tailored landing pages. The UX/Product persona will see the relevant portfolio pieces on *their* dedicated page (`/ux-and-portfolio`). The other two personas don't need to see UX case studies; it just creates noise and confusion.
    - **Recent Wins (Resume Section):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** This is redundant and adds massive cognitive load. Your authority is already established by the hero section's logos and the testimonials. This resume-like block forces the user to read and analyze your career history when they should be making one simple choice. This content belongs on LinkedIn or can be woven into the case studies on the `/ux-and-portfolio` page. Keeping it here kills momentum and hurts the triage conversion rate.
