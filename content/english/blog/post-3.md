## Overview

For the PepsiCo Partners trade show, my objective was to create an interactive multi-device touchscreen experience that would captivate attendees, showcase their new recurring order capabilities, and drive lead generation. I led the development of all digital and software aspects of the project, managing a cross-functional team of developers and designers to deliver a high-impact experience under a tight timeline. My role was to translate complex stakeholder requirements into an intuitive, engaging user journey, using rapid prototyping and iterative testing to ensure we met both business goals and user needs.


## The Challenge & Goals

The core challenge was to cut through the chaos of a crowded trade show floor. We had to achieve several key business goals:

- Announce and clearly demonstrate PepsiCoâ€™s new recurring order capabilities.
- Design an experience so engaging it would convert attendees into customers.
- Seamlessly strengthen the sales funnel by directing users to on-site sales representatives.

Accomplishing this meant simplifying complex product value propositions into digestible, intuitive interactions, all while navigating the significant constraints of a tight timeline and limited resources.

## My Role

I led the development of all digital and software-based aspects of this project, balancing a tight timeline with complex stakeholder requirements. My responsibilities spanned serval areas:

- **Ideation and Strategy**
Facilitated brainstorming and storyboarding sessions to define the user journey and experience.
- **Team Leadership**
Managed cross-functional teams of developers and designers, ensuring seamless communication and delivery on an aggressive schedule.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**
Presented prototypes, articulated design decisions, and maintained transparency with clients and internal teams.
- **Iterative Testing**
Guided the project through multiple design iterations based on user feedback, ensuring alignment with client goals and user needs.

### Iterative Design and Refinement

The entire experience was built on a foundation of rapid iteration and refinement. The screen flow underwent multiple cycles of testing, allowing us to seamlessly integrate animations, user workflows, and clear calls to action. We prototyped every key interaction, from the frictionless contact capture screen to the step-by-step simulations of the new recurring order feature. Four key value propositions were brought to life with custom animations controlled by user touch gestures, ensuring that every element was not only intuitive but also visually engaging.

### Wire-framing and Storyboarding

The project began by creating low-fidelity wireframes and storyboards that served as our strategic blueprint. These initial visualizations mapped every step of the user journey, from the first touchpoint to the final handoff to a sales representative, ensuring every interaction had a clear purpose.

### Simplifying the Complex

With our strategy mapped, we transformed the standard ordering process into a guided, interactive walkthrough. This allowed users to simulate placing and managing recurring orders step-by-step, clearly demonstrating the platform's ease of use and value in a live, hands-on environment.

### Tactile Interactivity

Finally, to make the experience memorable, we layered in polished, custom animations controlled by touch. A standout feature allowed users to swipe to transition from day to night, providing a moment of tactile delight that showcased the platform's responsive and engaging nature.

## End Result

The exhibit was a definitive success, cutting through the trade show noise to attract high foot traffic. Visitors praised the intuitive, tactile design, and this high level of engagement directly translated into more meaningful conversations with sales reps, strengthening the overall sales funnel.

This project is a clear example of how a focused, user-centered design process can deliver an impactful experience, even under the pressure of a tight timeline. By grounding our creative animations and interactive workflows in rapid prototyping and iterative testing, we ensured every element served the core business goals. The key takeaway for me was clear: in a fast-paced environment, an agile and collaborative process is the foundation for creating engaging experiences that deliver measurable results
