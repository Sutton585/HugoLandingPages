# Page Build Plan
## Objective
This plan outlines the conversion of the current Notion page content into a final, high-performance landing page. The primary goal is a rapid deployment using pre-built Hugoplate components, adapting the existing copy to fit the new, strategic layout.

## Process
1. Review Source Content: Analyze the current version of the page as it exisits in our current Notion version of the landing page. (`## Current Notion Version`)
2. Incorporate Feedback: Integrate the strategic improvements and suggestions for the newer version. (`## Proposed improved version to consider`)
3. Develop a Rapid Draft: Adapt the existing copy for a quick launch, focusing on the most critical messaging for our goal and intended personas (leverage-first, use 80/20 rule). 
4. Map Page Structure: Outline the page by sequencing the required Hugoplate design components. (`## Outline with Prebuilt Design Components`)
5. Build and Deploy: Assemble the final page ready for Hugo publishing.(`## Full Version`)

    > begin of new section: "Features" or "services" section of landing page, showing my value accross three domains. I think this might get adjusted, it needs some work and it might not address everything important it should address. maybe it should focusing on offers like "UX Maturity Audits, Workflow Automation, Team Design & Staffing, Workshops & Sprints, Fractional Leadership." or use a differnt three-category layout of my value: 1. UX/Product Leadership Managment and Ops, 2. UX/Product Individual Contributor and UX Research, 3. UX/Product Staffing Consultant and Auditing (ie. UX maturity audit, product/website UX tear-downs), workshop facilitation (ie. design sprint for rapid MVP dev), custom playbook creation, etc...

    > start of section: CTA card focused on a lead magnet for the less technical HR or recruiter that's reviewing my portfolio to decide if they should pass my application along to hiring manager. they might not know exactly what to look for in a ux portfolio, so my lead magnet is a short guide laying out basic UX team design, the roles and their responsibilities, and what to look for on thier background, and basics of interviewing them on their experience. overall goal of this guide is to show that I'm a great candidate for any of those roles (and i should back that up on this portfolio page) but i also want to show them my value in staffing, team design and I can even have a cta in the guide about i can consult with them for team design, interviewing, or even do the staffing for them for ux teams (i'd subcontact the work and carry the contract myself).

If my application got passsed to the hiring manager, that person knows what to look for in a UX portfolio, so myu lead magnet for them in more tuned to ensuring the overal org is getting most out of UX and human centered design principles. This is essentially the neilson norman ux maturity audit i'd charge for, they'd fill outt my form and it would allow me very informed feedback for them on where things stand and I can give them actionable info on pushing things forward. Between this lead magnet and the previous one, I can capture both primary personas that are looking at my UX portfolio.

    ### CareerStart / WAE
    
    **Post-COVID hiring was broken.**
    
    WAE, a rapid-deployment staffing platform, was built fast-but inherited UX debt, friction between teams, and disjointed design/dev workflows.
    
    **What I did**
    
    - Led a full audit across product, UX, and dev practices
    - Embedded research sprints to validate and align feature work
    - Implemented dual-track DesignOps framework with reusable docs
    - Rebuilt job scheduling flows based on live user data
    
    **Impact**
    
    - Cut scheduling time by **50%**
    - Boosted user satisfaction by **44%**
    - Enabled future teams with a centralized, modular UX system

    ### Monroe Community College
    
    **Admin chaos was harming equity programs.**
    
    A vital healthcare certification program was managed through a patchwork of Google Sheets-causing frequent errors and staff burnout.
    
    **What I did**
    
    - Audited and rebuilt their internal ops with scalable logic
    - Automated retest scheduling, grading, comms, and tracking
    - Used Google Apps Script to centralize source-of-truth systems
    
    **Impact**
    
    - Slashed instructor admin time
    - Eliminated grading errors and record mismatches
    - Delivered a reusable, scalable solution for future cohorts
    
    ### Xerox
    
    **Design-to-dev lag was choking momentum.**
    
    Across two enterprise SMB B2B UX/dev teams, design feedback loops took 6+ weeks due to scattered tools and minimal ops support.
    
    **What I did**
    
    - Audited pipelines and documentation bottlenecks
    - Rolled out modular design systems and testing resources
    - Standardized feedback flows across teams
    
    **Impact**
    
    - Cut feedback cycles by **80%**
    - Enabled devs to ship faster with less rework
    - Created a scalable, ops-backed testing playbook
    
    ### Upstate UX
    
    **Western NY had talent-but no UX infrastructure.**
    
    Upstate UX was built from scratch to connect students, professionals, and employers in a dead zone for UX community.
    
    **What I did**
    
    - Founded the region's first and most active UX mentorship and events group
    - Led IDEO design thinking certification for 100+ attendees

    - Built a peer-led ecosystem that runs beyond my direct support
    - Facilitated hiring and mentoring across industries
    
    ### Crashtest
    
    **Students had to test-but had no testing system.**
    
    RIT's design/development curriculum required UX testing but provided no infrastructure. Crashtest filled that gap.
    
    **What I did**
    
    - Founded and scaled a hands-on UX/game testing community
    - Built templates, playbooks, and volunteer onboarding flows
    - Partnered with faculty for curriculum integration
    
    **Impact**
    
    - Served 100s of students across departments
    - Became a core part of RIT's programs

## Proposed improved version to consider

    
    # UX & Portfolio Page: Strategic Layout & Analysis
    
    ## Page: /ux-and-portfolio
    
    ### **Strategic Function**
    
    This page has a critical dual purpose. For **job applications**, it must immediately present as a credible portfolio with easily accessible case studies. For **consulting leads**, it must function as a high-conversion landing page that diagnoses a visitor's pain and funnels them toward a high-value engagement (an audit) or a trust-building lead magnet (a guide). The structure is designed to guide two distinct personas—the **uninformed gatekeeper** (HR/Recruiter) and the **UX-aware leader**—to the specific solution they need.
    
    ---
    
    ## Revised Page Structure & Content
    
    ### **Section 1: Hero**
    
    - **Component Type:** Hero Section
    - **Intention:** Establish top-level authority and frame your expertise. The copy "Experience. Design. Systems." immediately positions you as a strategic, operational thinker, not just a designer. The sub-headline provides the necessary brand credibility (Xerox, Apple) to command attention from either audience.
    
    # Experience. Design. Systems.
    
    I've led UX and Product ops for startups like WAE, enterprise teams at Xerox and Apple, and communities like Upstate UX and Crashtest at RIT.
    
    Whether you're sprinting to MVP or solidifying operations, I help reduce drag and increase flow. I can lead, fill gaps, or coach you to the next level.
    
    > NOTE: Your hero copy is excellent. It's concise and authoritative. We're removing the generic email/linkedin links. The implicit CTA for this hero is "See the proof below." A visitor looking for a portfolio will naturally scroll to the work, and a potential client will see your credibility before scrolling further.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 2: The Portfolio**
    
    - **Component Type:** Portfolio Gallery
    - **Intention:** This section is placed immediately after the hero to satisfy the primary requirement of a portfolio page. Hiring managers can instantly see your work. For consulting leads, this gallery acts as immediate, tangible proof of the claims made in the hero.
    
    # Featured Work
    
    Examples of real impact: Smooth ops, intuitive products and measurable results.
    
    > [Card gallery of 4-6 primary case studies is displayed here. Each card links to a detailed case study page.]
    > 
    > - card: User-Centered Design and Scalable Collaboration @ WAE
    > - card: Revolutionizing Multi-interface UX @ Xerox
    > - card: Interactive Gaming Experience @ MSM
    > - card: Engaging Interactive Experiences @ PepsiCo
    
    > NOTE: This is perfectly placed. It serves the portfolio function immediately. The key is that each card must link to a detailed, well-structured case study page. I recommend using the powerful content from your "Recent Wins" section to build out those full case study pages, as it's already in the perfect format (Problem, Action, Impact).
    > 
    
    ### **Section 3: The System Behind the Work**
    
    - **Component Type:** Features / Services Section
    - **Intention:** This section bridges the gap between portfolio and landing page. It answers the question, "How do you achieve the results I just saw?" It reframes your skills as solutions to common operational pains.
    
    # Product slows. UX chases tickets. Docs fall behind.
    
    It’s not just about clean design. It’s the scalable systems that support your team when it matters most. Here's how I help:
    
    ### **Strategic Leadership & Ops**
    
    From team design and staffing to governance and onboarding, I install the rituals that allow teams to scale without chaos.
    
    ### **Workflow & Design Systems**
    
    I create clarity across research, design, and dev with scalable agile workflows, robust design systems, and documentation that actually gets used.
    
    ### **Audits & Facilitation**
    
    I uncover growth potential with UX Maturity Audits, accelerate development with MVP Sprints, and provide embedded coaching to level up your team.
    
    > NOTE: I've reframed your three columns based on your notes. Instead of separating roles (IC vs. Leadership), this structure organizes your value into three core service categories that a client would actually buy: Strategy, Execution, and Diagnostics. This is much clearer and more compelling. It directly presents your offers as the solution to the headline's pain statement.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 4: Targeted Conversion**
    
    - **Component Type:** Dual Call-to-Action (CTA) Blocks
    - **Intention:** This is your lead-capture engine. Having two distinct, persona-targeted CTAs is highly effective. You're speaking directly to each of your primary lead types and offering them a tailored, high-value asset.
    
    > [First CTA Block, for the Recruiter/HR Persona]
    > 
    > 
    > ## De-risk UX Staffing
    > 
    > Hiring UX shouldn't feel like bluffing through a foreign language. You don’t need to learn buzzwords, you need to cut through the noise.
    > 
    > **[Button: Get the Free No-Fluff UX Staffing Guide →]**
    > 
    
    > [Second CTA Block, for the UX-Aware Leader Persona]
    > 
    > 
    > ## Enable UX Success
    > 
    > Growing fast? Misalignment creeping in? Let's explore where your user-first practice excels and where we can push it even further.
    > 
    > **[Button: Start Your Free UX Maturity Audit →]**
    > 
    
    > NOTE: This is the strongest part of your landing page strategy. Placing these two CTAs side-by-side or one after the other works perfectly. It allows visitors to self-select, increasing the quality of your leads. The copy is strong and the offers are perfectly aligned with the personas.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 5: Social Proof**
    
    - **Component Type:** Testimonials Section
    - **Intention:** To provide third-party validation and build trust, reinforcing the decision to engage with one of your CTAs.
    
    # What others are saying
    
    > [Testimonial from Jennifer Kotler]
    > 
    > 
    > [Testimonial from Sean Boyle]
    > 
    
    > NOTE: Standard and effective. Its placement here, after the primary CTAs, helps to overcome any final hesitation a potential lead might have.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### **Removed Section & Rationale**
    
    - **Recent Wins (Expanded Summaries):**
        - **Reason for Removal (from this page):** This section, as written, creates critical redundancy. It competes directly with your "Featured Work" gallery and adds significant length and cognitive load to the page.
        - **Strategic Repurposing:** The content here is **excellent**—it's your most powerful asset. However, it should not live on this landing page. This content **IS** your detailed case study. Each "Recent Win" should be its own page, linked from the corresponding card in the "Featured Work" gallery. This creates a clean, professional portfolio structure: **Gallery on the main page -> Detailed, impact-driven case study on a sub-page.** This is the standard and most effective way to present a portfolio.


## Proposed Updates to improve my appeal for Systems Design Roles (comments located in quote sections)


### **Section 1: Hero**

# Experience. Design. Systems.

From startups to enterprise orgs like Apple, Verizon and Xerox, I create intuitive products and scalable systems to eliminate friction between design, product and engineering. I can lead, fill gaps, or coach you to the next level.

-   Rationale:
    - I considered replacing the H1 to include automation as a core competency. Something like "Design. Systems. Automation." But I don't think it's as strong. It reads as "Design systems automation" which is such a specific offering to be the heading of my UX portfolio. The issue with this is that I'm now missing any mention of automation, but maybe it's better suited to only be explicitly prioritized for the techOps landing page, and less prioritized here, and only hinted at in bizSystems.
    - I like this because it gives me two lanes and three services in plain language.
        Two lanes:
        - "I make intuitive products": individual contributor roles in UX/UI or product design
        - "I make scalable systems to eliminate friction between design, product and engineering": I make SYSTEMS. General. Systems design. Tooling. Automation. Workflows. Workshop facilitation potential. Consulting potential. Easy pitch for playbooks: "let's make YOUR system. It will be fine tuned to your team and needs based on my time with you." Leaders with ego will like being able to say "we have a system", something they can enforce and judge performance based on compliance to "our established system".
        Three services:
        1. "I can lead": Leadership or administrative   background roles that aren't seen as individual contributor.
        2. "I can fill gaps": Individual contributor roles, but also could refer to staffing. Long-term I want to offer staffing as a consultancy or agency. I like that the wording attacks both so that the phrasing works whether I fill the role myself or I contract it out. Either way, I'm filling gaps for you. Filling gaps can also be more generic "we're in a trnasitional period and need help through this rough patch", helping during a tough time, a gap in their normal processes, or the gap between systems before the new roll-out etc.
        3. "I can coach you to the next level": Coaching, consulting, workshop faciltation, retainer or fractional leadership roles. The only thing that's not as strong in this is I'd like to always consistently use "us" and "we" framing whenever possible. I'm not helping your product make more money, WE'RE enabling OUR team to perfect OUR collaborative approach, further improving the quality that OUR work is known for.

### Section 2: The Portfolio (No Major Copy Changes)

- Component Type: Portfolio Gallery
- Intention: This remains critical. It provides the immediate proof required for a portfolio page. No immediate changes to copy are needed here (mostly just formatting changes when we migrate to Hugo). Ensure case studies (the destination pages) are framed with the language of systems and operational impact.

### Section 3: The System Behind the Work (Revision needed)

- Intention: This is the most important area for driving realconverstion, getting our two primary personas for this page to find the lead magnet designed for them specifically. The HR gatekeeper and the Hiring manager. But we also need to make some revisions to more explicitly address the responsibilities lrelated to design system development, governance, tooling, and AI-powered acceleration.

- Old Copy:
    
    # Product slows. UX chases tickets. Docs fall behind.
    
    It’s not just about clean design. It’s scalable systems to support your team when it matters most.
    
    ### UX / Product
    - Build teams to scale without chaos.
    - Governance, onboarding, and rituals that work from day one.
    - [Support & resources for recruiters without the technical jargon](linkToLeadMagnetforHRAndRecruiters)
    
    ### UX Design / Ops
    - Clarity across research, design, and dev.
    - Scalable agile workflows, design systems, tooling.
    - Docs that stay useful. No more Slack archaeology.
    
    ### Audits / Facilitation
    - MVP Sprints: From ideation to active user data in a week.
    - [UX Maturity audits: Uncover growth potential in your org.](linkToLeadMagnetForHiringManagers)
    - Dual-track agile UX + embedded coaching.

- New Copy:
    # Your design system is drifting. Your engineers are frustrated.
    
    Inconsistency slows development, kills velocity, and burns your best talent. A world-class design system isn't a component library; it's a managed product that serves your designers and developers. Here's how I build it:

    ### 1. Vision, Strategy, & Roadmap
    
    I define the system's vision and own the roadmap and backlog. I establish scalable governance models and contribution workflows that drive adoption and consistency, ensuring the system evolves with the business.

    ### 2. AI-Accelerated Development & Tooling
    I leverage modern tooling to close the gap between design and code. This includes using AI for documentation and code generation (**ChatGPT/Copilot**), Figma-to-code pipelines (**Builder.io**), and automated accessibility testing (**Stark/Contrast**) to accelerate development and ensure parity.

    ### 3. Documentation, Mentorship, & Adoption
    A system is useless if no one uses it. I deliver high-quality documentation, create internal education materials, and act as a subject matter expert to evangelize the system's value and mentor product teams on best practices.

- Rationale:
    1. New Headline: The new headline speaks directly to the core pain of the hiring manager. "Design system is drifting" is a phrase they have likely said or thought.
    2. Reframed Services: The three columns are now explicitly mapped to the core responsibilities of the job description: **Strategy** (Roadmap, Governance), **Tooling** (AI, Figma-to-code), and **Adoption** (Docs, Mentorship).
    3. Keyword Integration: We've injected the specific AI tools (Builder.io, Copilot, Stark) mentioned in the job description. This signals direct, tangible experience and shows you are not just aware of the trend but have hands-on knowledge.

### Section 4 & 5: Targeted Conversion & Social Proof (No Change)

-   Your dual CTA and testimonials sections are still highly effective and require no changes. They serve their purpose of lead capture and building trust.

### Future: Ideas for the case studies

Your "Recent Wins" content, which you've wisely decided to move to individual case study pages, is your next point of leverage. Before you apply, ensure the following:

1. Re-frame the Xerox Story: Your Xerox case study is perfect. Frame it as a **DesignOps** and **Systemization** win.
    - Headline: "Cutting the Design-to-Dev Feedback Cycle in half at Xerox."
    - Problem: Explicitly mention the lack of a "shared visual and interaction language" and "scattered tools" leading to a 6+ week feedback loop.
    - Action: Detail how you "audited pipelines," "rolled out modular design systems," and "standardized feedback flows." This is the language of a systems designer.
    - Impact: Quantify the result: "Cut feedback cycles by 80%, enabling devs to ship faster with less rework."

2. Create an "AI in DesignOps" Mini-Case Study: You need a specific proof point for the AI requirement. This doesn't have to be a massive project. It can be a "Recent Win" about a smaller-scale intervention.
    - Example Narrative: "At Monroe Community College, manual administrative work was causing burnout. I audited their workflows and used Google Apps Script to automate scheduling and grading. While simple, this project demonstrates the core principle of my work: find the highest-leverage point of friction and apply a systemic, automated solution to eliminate it. The same principle applies when using GitHub Copilot to generate documentation for a design system or using Builder.io to accelerate prototyping—it's about building systems that free up human talent."
