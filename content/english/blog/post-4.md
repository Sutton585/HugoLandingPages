## Overview

At ExhibitorLIVE 2018, Mirror Show Management (MSM) needed to cut through the noise of hundreds of exhibitors and capture high-quality leads. My challenge was to design an immersive experience that would not only stop attendees in their tracks but also compel them to engage and share their information.

Leveraging my background in game design and UX, I led the creation of a multi-interface, RFID-enabled social gaming experience. This project was a unique opportunity to apply my passion for gamification and user experience design to a real-world business problem, creating a strategic tool that was both a centerpiece for the event and a powerful engine for lead generation.

## Innovative Gaming Experience

To solve the challenges of attention, engagement, and lead capture, I designed and led the development of a board-game-inspired multiplayer game. The experience was built around a central, wall-sized game board that created a spectacle for players and spectators alike.

Participants used physical game pieces at individual touchscreen podiums to register via RFID game pieces, linking their gameplay directly to their contact information. During the game, the glass walls turned opaque, one of which was covered in a giant display, totally immersing players in a private session where they answered industry-specific, scenario-based questions. Every element—from gestural dice rolls to animated "chance" cards that offered an "MSM Saves the Day" lifeline—was designed to be memorable, reinforce MSM's value proposition, and make the act of providing lead information a natural part of a fun, competitive experience.

## Capturing User Information

Upon registration, players:

1. Chose a custom physical game piece that was registered via RFID.
2. Entered their personal and business contact information, which populated the leaderboard and allowed for follow-up.

This allowed MSM to collected valuable lead data while delivering a seamless, engaging user experience.

## Immersive Game Mechanics
The entire experience was anchored by a central, wall-sized display that updated in real-time with player movements and scores, creating a focal point for both players and spectators. Key interactions were designed to be highly engaging, such as using gestural input to roll digital dice. The game also featured "chance" cards that introduced strategic risk, with a clever twist: players could use a special "MSM Saves the Day" card to negate negative effects. Hopefully this stuck as a memorable metaphor for MSM’s value proposition of turning challenges into opportunities.

## Tailored, Scenario-Based Journeys

The gameplay was designed to be a strategic reflection of MSM’s value. Players encountered a variety of themed question categories, each with distinct visuals to enhance clarity and engagement. These questions were not simple trivia; they were scenario-based interactions that required players to make strategic decisions mirroring real-world business challenges. This approach effectively showcased MSM’s ability to align solutions with client needs, turning a simple game into a powerful tool for setting the stage for meaningful, post-event conversations.
