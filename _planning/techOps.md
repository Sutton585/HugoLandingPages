# Page Build Plan
## Objective
This plan outlines the conversion of the current Notion page content into a final, high-performance landing page. The primary goal is a rapid deployment using pre-built Hugoplate components, adapting the existing copy to fit the new, strategic layout.

## Process
1. Review Source Content: Analyze the current version of the page as it exisits in our current Notion version of the landing page. (`## Current Notion Version`)
2. Incorporate Feedback: Integrate the strategic improvements and suggestions for the newer version. (`## Proposed improved version to consider`)
3. Develop a Rapid Draft: Adapt the existing copy for a quick launch, focusing on the most critical messaging for our goal and intended personas (leverage-first, use 80/20 rule). 
4. Map Page Structure: Outline the page by sequencing the required Hugoplate design components. (`## Outline with Prebuilt Design Components`)
5. Build and Deploy: Assemble the final page ready for Hugo publishing.(`## Full Version`)

    # Scale Without Spinning Plates
    
    Growth exaggerates existing alignment issues, compounding over time.
    
    Priorities start to shift, timelines drift, and every week feels more reactive than the last.
    
    From SMBs and startups to enterprise like Apple, Verizon, & Xerox, I help scaling teams regain control.

    > start of next section: services/features/etc. (here's how i help, services i offer, how i can help in different ways.) this might need to be more of a process display that mirror's the one in the other persona for less-techincal owner operators. recycle one templatable process or system, and sell it two differnt ways. In this persona, i think it makes more sense to call out alternative arrangements like fractional roles or retainer roles, that might not make sense in the other persona.

    # Growth doesn’t have to feel chaotic
    
    I map the chaos and quietly fix blockers so you won’t have to keep playing catch-up.
    
    ### Clarity sprint
    
    *Not sure where to start?*
    
    A one-week audit allows me to surface the friction and find leverage points.
    
    ### Operational Health
    
    *Spinning wheels? Scattered tools?*
    
    Streamline systems, simplify tooling, automation & AI.
    
    ### Scalable Support
    
    *High level support without full-time hire? Fractional and retainer support available*
    
    Gain a second brain, a quiet background fixer.

    > start of next section: CTA for if this leader/founder character knows what they want, and what they want is specifically in the product and UX domain, so i want to funnel them to that landing page/portfolio.

    # Got a product idea or platform to build?
    
    Working on a product, tech service, app, website? I can help! I've led design and systems strategy for startups, enterprise platforms, and specialize in scalable ops and MVP development.
    
    *Want to see how I've turned early ideas into scalable solutions?*[learn more](https://www.notion.so/link_to_ux_portfolio)

    > start of new section: brief "work history" section called "recent wins" that is almost like the job history section of a resume for context and authority. might be worth deleting this section, it might be redundant. might be worth using "blog posts" here for similar effect. unsure. I have a slightly different version of this section on each landing page, but it seems messy to maintain.
    Current idea: take this part of each landing page, combine into one master version, include only on the UX page as smaller individual "case studies".

## Proposed improved version to consider

    
    # Technical Operations Page: Strategic Layout & Analysis
    
    ## Page: /technical-ops
    
    ### **Strategic Function**
    
    This is a high-value consulting funnel targeting technically proficient leaders (CTOs, VPs of Eng, founders). It positions you as a peer-level operator who can diagnose and solve complex operational problems they understand but lack the bandwidth to address. The language is direct, confident, and focused on ROI, efficiency, and eliminating the operational drag that slows down development and burns out teams. The goal is to convert them into a paid diagnostic engagement (a "Clarity Sprint") that leads to a larger project, fractional, or retainer role.
    
    ---
    
    ## Revised Page Structure & Content
    
    ### **Section 1: Hero**
    
    - **Component Type:** Hero Section
    - **Intention:** To hook the visitor with a high-level problem they immediately recognize: the chaos of scale. It validates their experience and positions you as a credible expert who has solved this problem at the highest levels.
    
    ---
    
    # Scale Without Spinning Plates
    
    Growth exaggerates existing alignment issues, compounding over time. Priorities shift, timelines drift, and every week feels more reactive than the last.
    
    From startups to enterprise teams at Apple, Verizon, & Xerox, I help technical leaders regain control of their operations.
    
    **[Button: Start a 1-Week Clarity Sprint →]**
    
    > NOTE: The headline is strong. I've tweaked the sub-headline to speak directly to "technical leaders" and replaced the weak email/linkedin CTA with a direct, compelling button that introduces your primary offer immediately. This respects their time and gets straight to the point.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 2: The Problem**
    
    - **Component Type:** Empathy / Pain Point Section
    - **Intention:** To build immediate credibility by articulating the specific, nuanced problems that technical leaders face. This shows you're not a generic consultant; you understand their world.
    
    ---
    
    ## Growth Doesn’t Have to Feel Chaotic
    
    When you're scaling fast, the real problems aren't in the product; they're in the friction between the people building it.
    
    - **Your best engineers are bogged down** in endless status meetings and cross-team dependencies instead of shipping features.
    - **Your CI/CD pipeline is slick, but your pre-dev workflow**—from idea to ticket—is a black hole of competing priorities.
    - **"Tech debt" has become the excuse** for a lack of clear process, leading to duplicated work and preventable bugs.
    
    > NOTE: This new section is critical. It replaces the vague "Growth doesn't have to feel chaotic" section with sharp, specific pain points. A CTO or VP of Eng will read these and think, "This person gets it." This is how you earn the right to propose a solution.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 3: The Diagnostic Process**
    
    - **Component Type:** Process Section
    - **Intention:** To present your method as a structured, logical system. This appeals to an engineering mindset. It's not "consulting"; it's a repeatable process for identifying and eliminating inefficiency.
    
    ---
    
    # I Find and Fix the Blockers
    
    I map the chaos and implement quiet fixes to the system itself, so your team can focus on building, not catching up.
    
    ### **1. Map the Friction**
    
    We start by tracing the path of work from concept to deployment, identifying every handoff, meeting, and tool that creates drag on the system.
    
    ### **2. Isolate the Bottleneck**
    
    Using that map, we pinpoint the single biggest cluster that, if addressed, can have the greatest positive impact on velocity and morale.
    
    ### **3. Deploy a Systemic Fix**
    
    I deliver a durable, low-maintenance process improvement (Streamlined tooling, adjusted communication rituals, or a targeted AI/automation, etc.) that solves the problem without adding complexity. 
    
    > NOTE: This reframes your service into a clear, 3-step diagnostic process. It's the same core idea as on the SMB page, but reskinned with language that appeals to a technical leader ("Map the Friction," "Deploy a Fix"). It shows you have a repeatable, non-random methodology.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 4: The Offer**
    
    - **Component Type:** Primary CTA / Lead Magnet
    - **Intention:** To productize your entry-level offering. The "Clarity Sprint" is a perfect offer for this persona: it's time-bound, outcome-focused, and low-risk. It's a small, paid engagement that proves your value and builds the case for a larger one.
    
    ---
    
    ## The 1-Week Clarity Sprint
    
    Not sure where the real bottleneck is? Let's find it. In one week, I will conduct a quiet audit of your team's operations. You get:
    
    - A **Friction Map** of your current development lifecycle.
    - A concise, no fluff report identifying the **Top Leverage Points** for immediate improvement.
    - An **Actionable Roadmap** with clear next steps.
    
    **[Button: Schedule Your Clarity Sprint →]**
    
    > NOTE: This dedicated section elevates your "Clarity sprint" from a feature into the primary product of this page. It clearly defines the deliverables, which is crucial for this audience. It's a tangible, high-value offer that a busy leader can easily approve.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 5: The Proof (updated v2)**
    
    - **Component Type:** Testimonial & Mini Case Study Hybrid
    - **Intention:** To provide undeniable, peer-level proof that you solve complex operational problems. We'll frame the testimonial with a clear headline that states the business outcome, making the story's value instantly clear to a busy leader.
    
    ---
    
    ## Proof: Unblocking Parallel Workstreams at Xerox
    
    > "David and I served on a design team to develop a Human-Centered User Interface for a suite of new Xerox products. During the project, David could always be counted on to deliver unique solutions. In one instance, I needed the prototype to be in a specific state for user testing while other teammates needed to interact with it simultaneously to administer bug-fixes.
    > 
    > 
    > **David was able to program the prototype in a way that let me conduct user testing without interfering with the updates to the prototype.** He is an outstanding problem solver who would make an extraordinary addition to any team."
    > 
    > **Trish Terrance**
    > Experience Design Group, Xerox
    > 
    - **The Operational Impact:** This solution eliminated a critical bottleneck, allowing research and development workstreams to operate in parallel instead of sequentially, directly accelerating the feedback loop and time-to-market.
    
    > NOTE: This hybrid format is your most powerful option.
    > 
    > 1. **The Headline:** "Unblocking Parallel Workstreams" immediately frames the story as an operational win that a CTO or VP of Eng will recognize and value.
    > 2. **The Testimonial:** Trish's own words provide credible, third-party validation of your specific problem-solving skills. I've bolded the key sentence that describes the core action and result.
    > 3. **The Impact Statement:** This final bullet point explicitly translates the story into the language of your target persona—it's not just a cool technical trick; it's a solution that impacts "feedback loops" and "time-to-market."
    > 
    > This combination is far more persuasive than either a testimonial or a case study alone.
    > 
    
    ### **Section 5: The Proof (new mini case study v1)**
    
    - **Component Type:** Results / Mini Case Study Section
    - **Intention:** To provide concrete, quantifiable proof that your process works. This section should focus on operational metrics, not just UX outcomes.
    
    ---
    
    ## Quantifiable Impact
    
    ### **Xerox: From Blueprint to Execution Clarity**
    
    - **The Problem:** Slow, siloed feedback cycles between design and offshore development teams created a 6+ week lag, choking momentum.
    - **The Fix:** I audited the entire pipeline and rolled out a modular design and handoff system, standardizing feedback loops and testing resources.
    - **The Result:** Cut the design-to-dev feedback cycle by **80%**, enabling faster shipping with less rework.
    
    > NOTE: I've removed the generic list of projects. For this page, you need one hyper-relevant proof point. The Xerox story is perfect when framed this way—it's a clear operational win. You need to get more proof points like this that speak to velocity, efficiency, and reduced friction.
    > 
    
    ### **Removed Sections & Rationale**
    
    - **Cross-Sell CTA ("Got a product idea...?"):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** Funnel leak. This page is for leaders with an *existing* team who are struggling with *operational scale*. Pitching them on ideation for a new product is a completely different value proposition and dilutes the focus of this page.
    - **Recent Projects (Generic List):**
        - **Reason for Removal:** The proof on this page must be highly specific to operational challenges. A generic list of UX-focused projects weakens your position as an ops specialist. The single, focused, and quantifiable Xerox example is far more powerful for this audience than a scattered list.
